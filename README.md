# 🚀 ash - A Minimalist Custom Shell

Welcome to **ash**, a lightweight and customizable shell designed for a unique command-line experience. This project is in its **early development stage**, and new features are being actively added. Stay tuned! 🎉

## 📌 Features
- 🖌️ **Custom Theming**: Load and apply themes just like Linux shell themes.
- 📂 **Directory Navigation**: Easily move between directories using `cd`.
- 🏗️ **Modular Structure**: Theme settings are loaded separately from `theme_loader.py`.
- 🏃 **Execute Commands**: Run system commands directly from the shell.
- ❌ **Exit Gracefully**: Use `exit` to quit the shell safely.

## 📜 Installation
Clone the repository and run the shell:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arash-nm/ash.git
cd ash
chmod +x ash.py
./ash.py
```

## ⚙️ Configuration
You can customize the shell theme by modifying the `theme_loader.py` file or creating your own theme file.

## 📌 Usage
Run the shell and start using it:
```bash
./ash.py
```
Available commands:
- `cd <directory>` - Change directory
- `exit` - Quit the shell
- Any other valid system command
